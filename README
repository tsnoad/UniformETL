UNIFORM ETL

Background
----------
Up until now, the ETLs that we've used have been slow, unstable and indecipherably written - in short hard to maintain, and impossible to expand. The reasoning behind UETL is to create a lightweight ETL, that can be modified as required, tested till it bleeds, and installed on almost any hardware, anywhere.


Objectives
----------
The objective is to create an ETL that is:

1. Intelligent: smart enough to know when there's now data to process
2. Modular
3. Testable
4. Expandable


The Bits
--------

1. Extract

	Daemon		extract_daemon.php
	Watcher		process_watcher.php
	Launcher	extract_launcher.php
	Extract Script		extract.sh
	Database Script		extract.php

2. Transform

	Daemon		transform_daemon.php
	Watcher		transform_watcher.php
	Launcher	transform_launcher.php
	Transform	transform.php
	Model Boss	transform_models.php
	Models		transform_models/member_ids.php, transform_models/member_emails.php, etc.
	

3. API
